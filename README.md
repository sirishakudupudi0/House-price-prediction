# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
# 📋 Project Overview
The housing market is large and dynamic. Accurately predicting house prices can help buyers, sellers, and investors make better decisions. This project applies machine learning techniques on real estate data to identify key factors affecting house prices and build a predictive model with high accuracy.

# 🚀 Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices using historical real estate data. The goal is to identify important features, improve predictive accuracy, and provide data-driven insights for investors and businesses.

# 📚 Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Source: Publicly available real estate datasets.

#Steps taken:

Handled missing values (LotFrontage, MasVnrType, GarageType).

Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

Scaled numerical features to ensure uniformity.

# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Found strong correlations between features like house size, location, and price.

Discovered trends showing the impact of neighborhood and facilities.

Detected outliers influencing model performance.

# 🛠 Feature Engineering
Combined existing features (e.g., total area, total bathrooms).

Applied transformations to simplify complex relationships.

Added neighborhood average prices for contextual insights.

# 🤖 Model Selection and Training
Linear Regression: Baseline model.

Decision Trees and Random Forests: Captured complex non-linear patterns.

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): Provided the highest prediction accuracy.

# 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning
Used Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model parameters and avoid overfitting.

# 🧪 Model Evaluation
Evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared (R²)

Model	RMSE	R²
Linear Regression	35,460	0.853
Decision Tree	37,210	0.821
Random Forest	28,940	0.892
Gradient Boosting	27,860	0.902

# 🌟 Key Features Impacting Prices
House Size (square footage, number of rooms).

Location (neighborhood quality, surroundings).

Nearby Facilities (schools, transport, parks).

# 📈 Business Impact
Identifies profitable investment opportunities.

Supports strategic pricing based on market insights.

Reduces investment risks through data-driven forecasting.

# 🔮 Conclusion and Next Steps
Developed a predictive model with high accuracy.

# Future improvements:

Include economic indicators and broader data sources.

Apply explainable AI (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to improve model transparency.

Explore deep learning models for further performance gains.
